-- 0.1.17
MINOR DEVELOPMENT
20150806
Added support for PACK (Passwords Analysis and Cracking Kit) as an 
alternative to Pipal.
Added support for the results from the Get-ADUser script which details live
users
Added a new view to the database "listliveuserswithuncrackednt"
Added a new view to the database "listliveadminswithuncrackednt"
Moved NTLM brute forcing section to follow all other cracking
Reconfigured NTLM brute forcing section to require "extendedracking" to be true, 
when false it still does brute forcing up to 7 chars, but with reduced char set.

-- 0.1.16
BUG FIX
20150805
Realised that the dictionary that was used in the Pipal processing had vanished.
This was recreated so that the functionality works again!

-- 0.1.15
MINOR DEVELOPMENT
20141218
Added Pipal statistical analysis.  May consider removing some of the "home-grown"
analysis in the future...

-- 0.1.14
MINOR DEVELOPMENT
20141215
Reordered the cracking process to improve the speed at which results are
returned.  For example, usually get more quickly from the rock you d3ad0ne
against NTLM...

-- 0.1.13
MAJOR DEVELOPMENT
20140820
Rewrote the whole LM hash handling stuff.  Split it into first and second 
halves.  Doesn't sound like much but this was hard work!
Removed all references to John the Ripper (sorry mate!).  It was over-
complicating some of the procedures and was only really used to generate
dictionaries and turn LM hashes into NTLM hashes which will be done soon
just using hashcat and a rule file.

-- 0.1.11 and 0.1.12
BITS OF DEVELOPMENT
What a prat - managed to delete the changelog... :(  Let this be a lesson
to you - use GitHub for your change management!

-- 0.1.10
BUG FIX
20140710
Added a check to ensure that PostgreSQL is running and quits if not.
Added a string/replace for when providing an "FGdump" file and there
are blank hashes denoted by "no password*********************", it is 
more useful to have the real 'blank' hash...
Added a string/replace for when usernames have "non-standard" chars,
now they will be replaced with an asterisk (*).  This is for DB 
compatibility.
Indexes added on the currentclient, crackednt and crackedlm tables. 
Query optimisation performed on the listuserswithuncrackednt and
listuserswithuncrackedlm views.

-- 0.1.9
ADDING POLISH / BUG FIX
20140129
Updated some of the log messages because they just didn't make sense 
and added the CTRL+C catch to quit the script.
Realised that the LM hashes that were already in the DB were being 
repeatedly cracked.  Turns out I am a prat and was basing the LM 
crack run on the users that are identified as having an uncracked 
NTLM and the associated/generated pwdump file.  This required altering 
the DB to add a new view "listuserswithuncrackedlm" which is then used 
to create an LM based uncracked pwdump file.

-- 0.1.8
BUG FIX
20140128
References to dictionary files that don't exist because they were made 
with an old naming convention that I hadn't converted properly

-- 0.1.7
BUG FIX
20140124
Noticed that I was importing cracked LMs to the wrong fields in the DB, 
(i.e. plain to the crypto field and vice versa)

-- 0.1.6
DEVELOPMENT
20140123
Reviewed the logic behind some of the cracking sessions.  Realised that 
the target machine is not my laptop, instead a specialist box for 
cracking (so MUCH faster).  Split some of the functions into "awesome 
machine" and "non-awesome machine" functions so can be deployed in a 
variety of places.  This meant the introduction of brute forcing NTLMs 
to a certain level as well as LMs.  LMs are easy to crack up to and 
including the 5th character on any box, afterwards though gets a bit 
long winded.

-- 0.1.5
DEVELOPMENT
20140122
Wrote this CHANGELOG and the README

-- 0.1.4
BUG FIX
20131212
Fixed the bug where plain texts contain quote characts and causes the 
import to fail

-- 0.1.3
DEVELOPMENT
20131201
Migrated the early MySQL DB to PSQL and wrote the upload and download 
functions to it

-- 0.1.2
DEVELOPMENT
20131115
Adding comments and log messages to give it a little more structure

-- 0.1.1
DEVELOPMENT
20131101
Developed the DB structure and looked at the required "views" for 
later password analysis purposes

-- 0.1.0
DEVELOPMENT
20131020
Gave it a little more structure.  Wrote the detection of client names so 
that the script can run automatically.  Ran some tests and cleaned up 
some bugs - generally things like spelling mistakes etc.

-- 0.0.9
INITIAL
20131010
The script it borne of a list of commands used frequently by myself for 
cracking LM and NTLM hashes.  It has gone through many iterations already 
but is now a combination of psuedo code and commands in a rough order.  
Basically, a skeleton of what is needed from a cracking perspective.
