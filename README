=========================--- PWDB Scripts ---===========================
Automated LM and NTLM hash cracking scripts, database management and 
cracked password analysis including pretty graph drawing!

Motivation:
===========

Basically, cracking hashes and performing analysis on those that you cracked is a common 
task in a pen-testers day to day life.  It doesn't half seem to take up a lot of time 
though given, how straight forward the process should be once developed.  This meant I 
had standardised the commands I used on a regular basis to make it more efficient.  We 
then got a cracking box to share between the consultants and it was obvious even before 
this was launched that we were going to need a standard way of working with it and 
sharing the resource.  This set of scripts, known collectively as the PWDB scripts, aim 
to automate the process as much as possible to allow multiple users to make the best 
use of the technology.

Usage:
======

Depending on how you set it up, it could be as simple as uploading a few files.  Or as 
complicated as uploading a few files and executing the scripts manually.

There are a few files needed for best outcomes:

- PWDUMP file, created by a combination of Metasploit / Meterpreter / Incognito
  alternatively, you can also use the PWDUMP file generated by FGDUMP

- A domain enumeration file as generated with "Enum4Linux" which can be found here:
  http://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux/

- Once cracking as completed, analysis is performed with or without a "liveusers" file.
  Instructions for the generation of this file are given at the end of the initial 
  cracking run but essentially it utilises hydra with the SMB module.

The files should be named as follows:

PWDUMP :			[CLIENT NAME].pwdump
Domain Enumeration file :	[CLIENT NAME].domainenum
Live users file :		[CLIENT NAME].liveusers
